To play this game, run the GlowAnimation.java file. 

For optimal conditions change display settings to 100% text size by using System > Display > Scale & Layout > Change the size of text, apps, and other items.

Failure to do so may result in the game not working (Java rotation calculations aren't compatible with the Windows default setting).
